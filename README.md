# Simple Keylogger in Python

**Overview**

As part of my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I developed a simple keylogger in Python. This tool captures and logs keystrokes made on a keyboard, providing insights into how keylogging functions and its implications for security.

**Key Features**

**Keystroke Logging:**
The keylogger records every keystroke made by the user, saving them to a log file for later review.
**Special Key Handling:** 
It recognizes and logs special keys such as Enter, Space, Backspace, and Tab, differentiating them from regular alphanumeric characters.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Keystroke Capture:**

The keylogger listens to keyboard events and captures each keystroke. This includes both regular alphanumeric characters and special keys. The captured data is written to a text file, providing a record of all key presses.

**Special Key Handling:**

The tool includes functionality to handle special keys uniquely. For example, it logs the Enter key as a newline character, the Space key as a space, and other special keys with specific markers.

**Educational Value:**

Developing a keylogger offers valuable insights into how keylogging technology operates and its potential security implications. It serves as a practical example of monitoring and capturing user input, illustrating fundamental concepts in cybersecurity.

**Ethical Considerations:**

This keylogger is intended solely for educational purposes and demonstrates keylogging principles. It is crucial to use such tools ethically and ensure proper authorization and privacy considerations when dealing with sensitive information.

**Practical Applications**

Security Testing: The keylogger can be used for understanding keylogging techniques and assessing the security of systems against such threats.

Educational Tool: It serves as an educational resource to demonstrate how keystroke logging works and the importance of securing input methods.
